# Shift-To-Middle Array

The **Shift-To-Middle Array** is a dynamic array designed to optimize **insertions and deletions at both ends**, offering a high-performance alternative to implementing dynamic arrays, queues, dequeues. It achieves this while maintaining **contiguous memory storage**, improving **cache locality** and enabling **efficient parallel processing**.

## üåü Features

‚úÖ **Amortized O(1) insertions & deletions at both ends**  
‚úÖ **Fast random access (O(1))**  
‚úÖ **Better cache locality than linked lists**  
‚úÖ **Supports SIMD & parallel optimizations**  
‚úÖ **Minimizes memory overhead and avoids fragmentation unlike std::deque** <br>
‚úÖ **Dynamic biasing for push-heavy workloads (#define BIAS_MULT)** <br>
‚úÖ **Manual shrink_to_fit() to reclaim unused memory** <br>
‚úÖ **Optional bounds checking** <br>
‚úÖ **Optional automatic shrinking**

## üìå How It Works

Traditional dynamic arrays often suffer from costly shifts when inserting at the front, and structures like std::deque rely on fragmented memory blocks to mitigate this. The Shift-To-Middle Array takes a different approach: it dynamically re-centers data during resizing, ensuring balanced space on both ends and minimizing copying ‚Äî all while maintaining a contiguous memory layout.

## üöÄ Time Complexity Comparison

The following table compares the time complexity of Shift-To-Middle Array operations with other common data structures:

| Operation                  | Dynamic Array           | Linked List | Shift-To-Middle Array |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| Access (by index)          | O(1)                     | O(n)        | O(1)                 |
| Insertion at head          | O(n)                     | O(1)        | O(1) amortized       |
| Insertion at tail          | O(1) amortized           | O(1)        | O(1) amortized       |
| Insertion in middle        | O(n)                     | O(n)        | O(n)                 |
| Deletion at head           | O(n)                     | O(1)        | O(1) amortized       |
| Deletion at tail           | O(1)                     | O(1)        | O(1) amortized       |
| Deletion in middle         | O(n)                     | O(n)        | O(n)                 |
| Cache Locality             | Excellent                | Poor        | Excellent            |

## üèÜ Performance Benchmarks
Benchmarks comparing **Shift-To-Middle Array vs. `std::deque` vs. ExpandingRingBuffer vs. `std::queue`** demonstrate that performance improvements depend on **CPU and GPU capabilities**, such as **multi-core parallelism, SIMD optimizations, and cache efficiency**.

The benchmarks were compiled using **GCC with the `-O3` optimization flag**, ensuring high-performance execution. Results vary based on **hardware specifications** and **workload characteristics**.

üìÇ Installation & Compilation
The Shift-To-Middle Array is a single-header, templated C++ class. To use it, simply include ShiftToMiddleArray.h in your project. Requirements: C++20 or later and a standards-compliant compiler (I used g++).

To run the **Java benchmarks**, ensure you have the **Trove library** installed. Compile and execute using:
```sh
javac -cp trove-3.0.3.jar; ShiftToMiddleArrayBenchmarkTrove.java
java -cp trove-3.0.3.jar; ShiftToMiddleArrayBenchmarkTrove
```

## üèõ History

The Shift-To-Middle Array was independently developed by Attila Torda as a personal project during free time, aiming to create a more efficient implementation strategy for lists and deques. This project explored whether a contiguous-memory approach with dynamic mid-shifting could offer better balance for insertions, deletions, and random access.

- **Designed and implemented without academic/financial support, relying on open-source tools and iterative testing.**
- **Initial results showed promise, with one ICCS 2025 reviewer noting the method‚Äôs "reliability" compared to ArrayLists/linked lists (Score: 4/5 on results presentation).**
- **Areas for improvement identified: deeper benchmarking and formal literature review.**

After the publication I implemented the **bias** feature. I plan to make more tests, benchmarks and improvements, then planning to port the data structure to other languages and ecosystems.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Is this just a ring buffer?** <br>
No ‚Äî a ring buffer is a fixed-size circular structure that wraps around when full. The Shift-To-Middle Array is dynamically resizable and allows both ends to grow without wrapping. Unlike ring buffers, it can handle arbitrary growth while maintaining amortized O(1) operations and fast random access.

**Did you reinvent the array-based deque?** <br>
In spirit, yes ‚Äî but with a different approach. Originally, the Shift-To-Middle Array was designed as an alternative to list implementations, providing better memory efficiency and cache locality. Later, it evolved to handle both queues and deque operations, and with the addition of the bias feature, it dynamically optimizes the allocation based on usage patterns.

**Why not resize with an asymmetric buffer if most operations are push_front or push_back?** <br>
You can! The Shift-To-Middle Array supports dynamic biasing via a bias parameter. When enabled (with #define BIAS_MULT), the buffer adjusts headroom during resizing based on recent usage patterns ‚Äî giving more space to the side you're actively pushing to. It's automatic and tunable.

**Is this better than std::deque?** <br>
For many cases, yes: <br>
‚úÖContiguous memory improves cache performance. <br>
‚úÖNo fragmentation simplifies allocator usage. <br>
‚úÖEasier SIMD and memory-aligned optimizations.

**Will this ever be in the STL?** <br>
Unlikely ‚Äî the STL already has std::deque, std::vector, std::list, etc., and avoids redundancy. But this structure could live in performance-focused libraries or game engines where custom memory layouts matter.
